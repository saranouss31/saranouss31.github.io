My name is Saran Ousseini. I am a 22 years student from Southern New Hampshire Univeristy. I will be graduation at the ed of April with my Bachelor in Science in Biology. During my time at Souther New Hampshire University, I was able to take coding class called Bio-informatic. 
This class introduced me to R-Studio, though me the basics of coding. 
I was able to explore more about the new wave of science with is the mix of biology and informatics/coding. This class uses technlogy like computers,  databases, uses  math, and statistics to analyze, collect, organize, and store large amounts of biological information. Through this class I was able too observe biological data works that could have taken weeks to archieve, be done in less than a minute.
 Some of the project I was able to work one are:

My first project is called Penguin Analysis. This is the project that introduced me to the basics of bioinformatics 
We used Palmer Penguin data set to learn how R studio works. We ran analysis, and ran different codes. We used small subset of 44 pensguin. This analysis can be found [Here](https://saranouss31.github.io/BioStatisticsAnalysis/PalmerPenguinsAnalysis.html) 

My second project focused on practicing technical analysis skills, such documenting and communicating analysis, conducting exploratory analysis, generating hypotheses, and connecting exploratory analysis to hypotheses. In this project, I made a new notebook and wrote an abstract and an introduction, annotated exploratory analysis with a narrative, continuing exploratory analysis, generating hypotheses, and using Git to push changes to a GitHub repository. All of this was done by using the datas from Bird Bath, and running different codes in order to make chart, graph and finding connection within all of the data acquired, The analysis can be found [Here](https://github.com/saranouss31/BioStatisticsAnalysis/blob/12e4ef7759c7a2e7f0d19c07d0f4c464e6a5c0ba/bird_bathsSaran.html)
