My name is Saran Ousseini. I am a 22 years student from Southern New Hampshire Univeristy. I will be graduation at the ed of April with my Bachelor in Science in Biology. During my time at Souther New Hampshire University, I was able to take coding class called Bio-informatic. 
This class introduced me to R-Studio, though me the basics of coding. 
I was able to explore more about the new wave of science with is the mix of biology and informatics/coding. This class uses technlogy like computers,  databases, uses  math, and statistics to analyze, collect, organize, and store large amounts of biological information. Through this class I was able too observe biological data works that could have taken weeks to archieve, be done in less than a minute.
 Some of the project I was able to work one are:

My first project is called Penguin Analysis. This is the project that introduced me to the basics of bioinformatics 
We used Palmer Penguin data set to learn how R studio works. We ran analysis, and ran different codes. We used small subset of 44 pensguin. This analysis can be found [Here](https://saranouss31.github.io/BioStatisticsAnalysis/PalmerPenguinsAnalysis.html)
